                    <p>Technologies we thought were impossible and those we are yet to imagine will be primarily run by code. The positive impact of coding on the future of coding and our future lives is gradually yet increasingly comprehensible. While the development of technology is perpetual in the modern world, coding will become more prominent on a daily basis than ever before.</p>
                    <p>Fields such as banking, medicine, and journalism which are not directly connected to computer science will soon require some knowledge of coding at the minimum. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Coding is the literacy of the 21st Century, given its amplifying global use. As a result, further qualities in the field are necessary, because writing software is about expression, creativity, and practical application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This further emphasizes the importance for kids to learn to alter, break, and combine code in a revolutionary way. Many predict that the next generation of kids will use code, unlike the present generation which uses words. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In terms of programming, the new objective is to write less or no code in lieu of pristine and perfect code. Over the next decade, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) should automate most coding, in turn allowing programmers to efficiently write better code. Such implementations will also save companies a lot of precious time and money. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Another groundbreaking breakthrough set to transfigure coding is 5G, which offers an expanded network and computing capacity. New programming languages can take advantage of this supplementary power and programmers can benefit from the computing capabilities, especially for transformational projects. Furthermore, 5G boasts the requisite speed and power to elevate augmented reality and virtual reality across numerous fields. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In summary, the automation of writing code in conjunction with innovative technologies will absolutely revolutionize the field of computer science and our daily lives. With the developer world already taking farther leaps and bounds towards a better, technology-based world, computer science in general will be redefined.
