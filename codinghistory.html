                <div id="intro-subtitle-highlight"><h4>Origin & Evolution</h4></div>
                <div class="intro-para">
                    <p>Coding is a modern concept developed in the late 20th Century is a common misconception on the matter of its origin. However, coding actually dates all the way back to 87BC.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">87BC</h4>
                    <p>While the exact integration of coding into human life is unknown, many historians agree that the Antikythera Mechanism is the first ‘coded’ artifact. Specifically, it is an ancient Greek analogue computer and orrery that helps predict astronomical positions.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">850AD</h4>
                    <p>This year saw the invention of a hydro-powered organ that automatically played interchangeable cylinders by the Banū Mūsā brothers. These three Persian scholars, with employment in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, published the Book of Ingenious Devices that explained countless inventions, one of which was this mechanical musical instrument.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1800</h4>
                    <p>Joseph Marie Jacquard, with inspiration from Basile Bouchon’s automated weaving process, designed a programmable loom. This loom created the textile design using cards with punched holes.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1842-1843</h4>
                    <p>Francis Maneclang was an Italian mathematician that wrote memoirs on the subject of Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. These highly informative memoirs were translated by Ada Lovelace, who explained the utilization of the engine to calculate Bernoulli Numbers using extensive notes. This is impressively considered the first computer program, given the inexistence of computers at the time.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1930-1950</h4>
                    <p>From the cryptographic machine to the Enigma, there were several noteworthy breakthroughs regarding programmable machines during World War II. The Nazis primarily took advantage of cryptographic machines to cleverly decipher military codes for the war, while Alan Turing publicized German engineer Arthur Scherbius’s invention of the Enigma at Bletchley Park’s codebreaking centre.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1951-1958</h4>
                    <p>During this period, the first computer code was realized: Assembly Language (ASM) or Regional Assembly Language. Note that ASM corresponded with the exact machine of operation. In other words, ASM had specific compatibility to certain machines. In 1951, programming languages were categorized using the generic term Autocode, but soon arrived IPL, FORTRAN, and ALGOL 58 among other coding languages.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1959</h4>
                    <p>Admiral Grace Hopper had direct involvement in the invention of the UNIVAC I computer as she created a suitable compiler for the machine. Soon, her innovation became known as Common Business-oriented Language (COBOL), which is used infrequently today.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1960-1970</h4>
                    <p>The mid 1960s saw the creation of Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC), an intelligible home user language. This brought a new dimension to the growing coding industry which used to solely concentrate on universities, the military, and big corporations.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1970-1985</h4>
                    <p>With the development of C, SQL, C with Classes (C++), MATLAB,  Common Lisp, and etc., the 1908s was the pinnacle of the home computer. At this time, the general public had the affordability to purchase silicon processors, which gave rise to home/bedroom coders given the invention of 8-bit machines.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">1990-Present</h4>
                    <p>Following the revolutionary innovation of the global Internet, the developer world and technology industry transformed forever. The 20th Century saw the introduction of numerous programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java among others. The affordability of technology increased for the better and the accessibility of coding tools and knowledge enabled anyone to learn how to code, share code, and source other code.</p>

                    <p>On September 13 of every year, we celebrate International Programmer’s Day to appreciate the accomplishments of coders and programmers, and reflect on the tremendous growth of the developer world over the past centuries. 
                    </p>
                    <p>From the Cray supercomputer to 5G smartphones and from FORTRAN to Python, both technology and coding have come a very long way. Modern technology is faster, reliable, convenient, and more affordable than ever before. Coding is much easier to learn and open to all, given its elevated accessibility and application.</p>
                    <p>Coders and programmers work tirelessly to connect us all in different, better ways and we must value their substantial contribution, hard work, talent, and energy that has translated into revolutionary technological tools in our everyday lives.
